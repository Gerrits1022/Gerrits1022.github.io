        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image1.jpg">It was a dream of my Mom and I to take a trip to Italy, and experiecne new cultures one day...so in 2024 after many setbacks...we made it happen.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image2.jpg">After my mother got diagnosed with cancer in 2020, the drive to make this trip a reality set in quick. It was her life dream to see Pompeii and the ruins of the ancient city.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image3.jpg">While my dream was to see the Roman Colosseum and the Roman Forum. We were both blessed enough in good health to see these wonderful staples of history with our own eyes.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image4.jpg">We started out our trip In Venezia, walking throughout the canals and trying out new foods that were culturally significant in Italy.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image5.jpg">After Venezia, we made our way to the city of Florence, which is known for their leather crafts. But I was absolutely in awe when we got to see the Tower of Pisa, I have been wanting to see the tower my whole life too, so when we arrived I was filled with joy.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image6.jpg">We were in a tour group throughout the whole trip there. We made so many lifelong friends and memories that will last a lifetime.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image7.jpg">One thing that made very thankful for while on this trip is having such a good connection with my parents. Some families arent that way unfortunately, but I am thankful to have spent time with my mom while in Italy.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image8.jpg">As a Star Wars nerd, I got to visit the Palace of Caserta, which is known in the Star Wars universe as the Theed palace of Naboo which was a significant location in Episode 1.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image9.jpg">We met so many people from around the United States who have many different stories to tell. Each of them told me a heartfelt story of why they chose to go to Italy.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image10.jpg">When the vacation was nearing its end, we decided to spend the last few days relaxing on the resort by our friends in the travel group.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image11.jpg">The lifelong friends that we made throughout this trip will never be forgotten, and will always have a special place in our hearts.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image12.jpg">This vacation will forever be on of my favorites in my lifetime, and I am very thankful to have been given the opportunity to experience it with my Mom and our newly made friends.</div>
